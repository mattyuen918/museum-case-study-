# Museum Case Study

This was a project I worked on during a co-op term at a science museum part of the [Association of Science-Technology Center (ASTC)](https://www.astc.org/). During this time, I performed data analysis and visualization of annual attendance numbers ranging from 2008-2018. 

This project looked at maximum attendance numbers based on guest membership type (Public, Membership, Group, School, Birthday), average yearly attendance, and comparing attendance between public and members.
